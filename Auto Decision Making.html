			<h1> Automated Decision Making</h1>
			<p style="margin-left: 150px;margin-right: 50px;"> 
				Automated decision-making is the process in which algorithms and machines make decisions. This is used all throughout our society. For example within business, health and education.

				<h4>You can ONLY carry out solely automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects if the decision is:</h4>

						<li>necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between an organisation and the individual </li>
						<li>authorised by law (for example, for the purposes of fraud or tax evasion)</li>

			<h3>Advantages of Automated Decision Making in AI</h3>
				<p>
				One of the key advantages of Automated Decision Making in AI is its ability to handle complex tasks and process vast amounts of data much faster than humans.
				AI systems can efficiently analyze patterns and correlations in the data to make informed decisions.
				This can be particularly useful in fields such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, where quick and accurate decision-making is crucial.
				</p>
		
			<h3>Challenges and Concerns</h3>
				<p>
				Automated Decision Making in AI also raises concerns and challenges.
				The algorithms used in these systems are created by humans and are susceptible to biases and errors present in the data used for training.
				Biased data or flawed algorithms can lead to unfair or discriminatory decisions.
				It is crucial to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations when designing and implementing AI systems to mitigate these risks.
				</p>
		
			<h3>Ensuring Responsible Automated Decision Making</h3>
				<p>
				To address these challenges, efforts are being made to develop frameworks and regulations that promote responsible and ethical Automated Decision Making in AI.
				These frameworks aim to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems.
				They emphasize the importance of human oversight, continuous monitoring, and regular audits to minimize biases and errors.
				It is essential to strike a balance between the efficiency and accuracy of automated decision-making systems and the need for human judgment and ethical considerations.
				</p>
		
			<h3>Risks</h3>
				<p>
				Automated decision making in the workforce carries risks, including biases, lack of human judgment, and technical failures.
				Organizations must monitor and evaluate these processes to ensure fair and accurate outcomes, especially as data cahnges over time.
