			<h1>Environmental Effects</h1>
				<p style="margin-left: 160px; margin-right: 50px;"> 
				The advancement of technology has brought numerous benefits to society but has also raised major concerns about its environmental impact.
				As technology evolves, understanding and mitigating its effects on the environment becomes increasingly important for a sustainable future.
				Some examples include air, water, heat and noise pollution.
				All caused by the procution and use of technology.
				Yet, another example is the use of precious resources like gold and coal.

				<h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
					<p>
					Technology has played a crucial role in advancing renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower.
					These technologies have helped reduce the use of fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and slow climate change.
					</p>
	
	
				<h3>Resource Depletion</h3>
					<p> 
					One big risk associated with the environmental effects of technology is resource depletion.
					The manufacturing, use, and disposal of technology devices contribute to the extraction and consumption of finite resources such as minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
					The high demand for these resources can lead to overexploitation, ecological damage, and depletion of natural reserves and impacting ecosystems.
					</p>
			
				<h3>E-Waste and Pollution</h3>
					<p>
					Another risk is the generation of electronic waste and associated pollution.
					As technology advances and devices become obsolete at a faster pace, e-waste accumulates at great rates.
					Improper disposal and inadequate recycling practices of electronic devices can release hazardous substances into the environment, including toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and greenhouse gases.
					This not only poses risks to human health but also contributes to air, water, and soil pollution, further deteriorating the environment.
					Our company is very reliant on refurbished tech.
